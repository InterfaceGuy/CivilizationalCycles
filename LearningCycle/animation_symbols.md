## Recommendations for Three Cycles:
For visual clarity and recognizability, these three might work best:

1. Classical Greek (Aristotle + geometric/mathematical symbols)
2. Renaissance (da Vinci + perspective/anatomy symbols)
3. Modern Science (Einstein + quantum/digital symbols)

These offer the clearest visual distinctions and most recognizable iconography.
