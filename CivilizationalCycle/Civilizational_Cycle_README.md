# Civilizational Cycle

The Civilizational cycle, spanning approximately 1000 years, is a concept primarily associated with Oswald Spengler's theory of historical development. This cycle encompasses the entire lifespan of a civilization, including:

1. Birth/Spring: Emergence of a new cultural worldview
2. Growth/Summer: Cultural flourishing and expansion
3. Maturation/Autumn: Increasing materialism and rationalization
4. Decline/Winter: Loss of cultural vitality, focus on technology and empire

Key aspects:

- Each civilization has a unique "prime symbol" or worldview
- The cycle is seen as organic and deterministic
- Civilizations are viewed as largely isolated, not learning from each other

Examples of civilizational cycles according to Spengler:

- Classical (Greco-Roman): 1100 BCE - 400 CE
- Magian (Byzantine-Arabic): 0 - 1400 CE
- Faustian (Western): 900 - 2200 CE (projected)

This theory provides a grand narrative for understanding the rise and fall of major cultural complexes, though it has been criticized for its determinism and lack of emphasis on inter-civilizational learning.
